1)Creating new branch in GitHub website doesn't reflect in local system
First to check the available branches through localsystem Use command "git branch -a"

2)To pull(reflect changes) the newly created branch,use command "git pull"

3)to open the newly created branch - git checkout branchname

4)To identify the diff b/w main and newly created branch - git diff branchname

5)To merge the two branches - git merge branchname (here branchname is another branch name which is not currently connected). Then after push the changes using "git push origin branchname"

6)we can merge the branches from the main repository - so there we have to raise pull request in GitHub 

7)In GitHub, if two branches updates at the same time/pull req -> Then should resolve those conflicts while merging one of the pull request
